# Learn4j

## Description

Learn4J is a web application where students can consult all courses that are offered by the Learn4J Education Center.
A course should contain a title, description, instructor and start date.
Students should also be able to enrol themselves in a course, but only for future courses (i.e. with a start date that is not in the past).
A teacher should be able to view all courses, upload a new course, edit an existing course and see which students have enrolled in a particular course.

Extra: Restrict the number of available places per course.
When a student tries to enrol in a course that is fully booked, they should be put on a waiting list, which a teacher can consult.
